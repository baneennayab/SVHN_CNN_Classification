# SVHN_CNN_Classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset. The goal is to recognize digits (0-9) from images of house numbers taken in street view settings.

Project Summary
The SVHN dataset consists of over 600,000 digit images in various conditions and backgrounds, making it a challenging task for image classification models. This project uses TensorFlow and Keras to build, train, and evaluate a CNN model specifically designed for this dataset.

Project Structure
SVHN_CNN_Classification.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for loading data, building the CNN model, training, and evaluating the model.
requirements.txt: A list of Python packages required to run the project.
Features
Data Loading: The SVHN dataset is loaded from TensorFlow's dataset library.
Model Architecture: A CNN model is built with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification.
Model Training: The model is trained on the training set of the SVHN dataset with appropriate hyperparameters.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics on the test dataset.
Image Prediction: Functionality to upload an image and make predictions using the trained model.
How to Use
